# Color calibration to save the eyes

## Particular context
I guess this is my own experience but I'm quite sure so many people suffer this. I already use "f.lux" but it is not sufficient.
Actually I have Chrome in dark mode, Firefox partially in dark mode backed by an extention (just some websites like Wikipedia & so)
and  some other programs in dark mode. So for me, it is sufficiant along with "work lake" option of "f.lux".

The problem is when I am surfing in the browser or when I switch apps, then sometimes between an app or a page in dark mode and another one which is not, then my eyes hurt.

So this is the sollution for all of that. It calibrates the screen when there is so much white the time you switch, and lowers brightness at that particular time.
